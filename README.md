# Simple-E-Commerce-
Responsive and Dynamic E-commerce Shoe store 
I developed a responsive e-commerce shoe store with six different shoes with dynamic product filtering, a shopping cart, and a mock payment form showcasing my CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills. 
This website allows users to browse about six different kinds of shoes ranging from basketball to running, and it also allows them to filter what type of shoes they want; for better usability, there is a small 
discretion beneath the image of every shoe to let users know a little bit about the shoe. After they are finished selecting the shoe,, they can proceed to checkout. I have included a mock payment plan that
simulates what the users would see if they went to purchase. 
To make this website active, I am currently setting up a host for the website and including PayPal and other payment forms to make the payment functional and for payments to go through. 
To make this website profitable, I need to scale up this website which is what I am currently doing, firstly I am focusing on putting more variety of shoes, and then I will expand on footwear; along with that, I plan on 
putting Google Sense ads and other ads that would play when a user interacts with the website.
